# Database Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for database management.

## Clear Database Script

**Purpose:** Deletes all data from the database while preserving the schema and app settings.

**Use case:** Starting with a fresh database for testing without having to recreate the schema.

### Usage

Run the script using npm:

```bash
npm run db:clear
```

Or directly with node:

```bash
node scripts/clear-database.js
```

### What it does

1. **Prompts for confirmation** - You must type `yes` to proceed
2. **Deletes all data** from the following tables (in order):
   - audit_log
   - credit_history
   - rent_payments
   - tenant_ledger
   - security_deposits
   - maintenance_requests
   - tenant_rooms
   - operator_expenses
   - admin_withdrawals
   - rent_updates
   - tenants
   - rooms
   - users

3. **Preserves:**
   - Database schema (all tables, indexes, views)
   - app_settings table (default configuration)

### Safety Features

- **Confirmation required:** You must explicitly type "yes" to proceed
- **Foreign key order:** Deletes child tables before parent tables to avoid constraint violations
- **Schema preservation:** Only data is deleted, not the table structure
- **Settings preservation:** Application settings remain intact

### Example Output
